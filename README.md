cdump
=====

This is a little web-app that parses and runs analysis CSV dumps from [compasscard.ca](https://www.compasscard.ca/). It can tell you how much you spend on transit every month, what stops you visit the most, and a bunch of other stuff.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
